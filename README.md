# :sparkles: moov_module :sparkles:

This module is a learning area for the Partner Engineering team. This is going to be a WIP for a while as we all learn.

The goal is create a module for the command `mv` in bash. Once it is a workable-`ish` form, we will move it under an ansible fork and begin testing.

## Procedure:

* Each week, the team decides which part of the module to study/write and who should do the things
* John, Jake, or Bianca do the assigned stuff and create a PR once it's done
* The other two will review and merge changes
* Everyone discusses edits, etc.


## Next Steps:

* Define examples (we need more)
* Tests should start getting worked on
* John doing testing and editing
* Jake to write tests and editing
* Bianca doing review
